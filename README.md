# Cinephile

A movie library web application with personalized movie management features. Users can access the home screen to search for movies using the [OMDBAPI](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and view detailed information about each movie. The application allows users to create and manage multiple movie lists, similar to YouTube playlists, with the option to set lists as public or private. The home page displays the user's different movie lists, and the search and list pages have a user-friendly and visually appealing layout inspired by popular websites. Comprehensive documentation is included, and the project is hosted online, with working links to both the live application and the source code repository provided. This project offers an engaging user experience for movie enthusiasts, enabling them to easily curate and share their favorite movie collections.
